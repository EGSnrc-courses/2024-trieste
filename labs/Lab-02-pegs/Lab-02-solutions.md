## 2.3. Create pegs data sets for water and lead

Define water using the ICRU90 recommended value of I = 78 eV and a density of
0.998 g/cm³ at 20 °C by using the density correction file
`water_icru90.density`. This highlights capability of EGSnrc to generate
stopping powers for air, graphite, and water according to ICRU90
recommendations.

### Explain the difference between the $\large e^-$ and $\large e^+$ data sets

> - Below 0.5 MeV the positron stopping powers are higher than electron stopping
>   powers; the reverse is true at higher energies. This is due to the
>   differences in collision stopping powers of these particles. The collision
>   stopping power is obtained by adding Bethe’s soft collision formula with a
>   hard collision expression based on the Møller cross sections for electrons
>   and on the Bhabha cross sections for positrons.
>
> - Below 2 $\large \times AE_\text{kin}$ the bremsstrahlung fraction is unity for
>   electrons because the outgoing electrons are not distinguishable. Here,
>   $\large AE_\mathrm{kin} = AE - {m_0c^2}$ (where $\large m_0c^2$ is the
>   electron rest mass) is the *kinetic part* of the production threshold $\large AE$.
>   By *convention,* the *secondary* electron is the one with the lowest energy.
>
>   Now imagine an incident electron with a kinetic energy of 1.5 $\large \times
>   AE_\mathrm{kin}$ is incident. For production to occur, the secondary must
>   have at least $\large AE_\mathrm{kin}$ kinetic energy. However, since there is
>   only 1.5 $\large \times AE_\mathrm{kin}$ worth of energy to divide between the two
>   particles, and more energy must go to the primary particle, it is not
>   possible to produce a new secondary that also has a larger kinetic energy
>   than $\large AE_\mathrm{kin}$. This is not the case for incident positrons,
>   because there are no target positrons in atoms.
>
> - At low energies the mean free path of the positrons is smaller than the
>   electrons. This is because positrons can also interact via annihilation
>   events. As the kinetic energy of the positron, $\large E_\mathrm{kin}$, goes
>   to 0, the annihilation cross section tends to infinity, hence their
>   interaction cross section will be larger at low energies. As $\large
>   E_\mathrm{kin}$ increases, the annihilation cross section decreases as
>   $\large\ln({E_\mathrm{kin}}/E_\mathrm{kin})$, and the differences between
>   electrons and positrons are given by the differences in the bremsstrahlung
>   and inelastic collision cross sections.

### Estimate the average photon energy outside a very thick lead shield which surrounds an intense source of 20 MeV electrons

> At high energies, bremsstrahlung production is significant, while for photons,
> pair production is the dominant interaction. For a source of 20 MeV electrons
> the most likely sources of photons emerging from a thick lead shield are:
>
> - Bremsstrahlung photons created by the initial electrons, and by higher order
>   generations of charged particles created via pair production (electrons,
>   positrons).
>
> - Annihilation photons from the positrons generated via pair production.
>
> This is evident from the fact that the bremsstrahlung contribution at 20 MeV
> is about 20% as seen in the `examin` output file for lead. On the other hand,
> if one looks at the relative contribution from the different possible photon
> interactions in lead (shown below), one can see that pair production dominates
> above 5 MeV.

> The photon mean free path in lead has a maximum at 3.5 MeV, which means
> 3.5 MeV photons are the *most likely* to emerge from a very thick lead
> shielding. However there will be photons of other energies around 3.5 MeV as
> can be seen from the wide maximum in the figure below.

> The large amount of electron-positron pairs produced will generate further

> Considering that the CSDA range, $\large R_\mathrm{CSDA}$, of 20 MeV electrons
